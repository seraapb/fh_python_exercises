Write a program that prints out the message "hello world!" and then asks "shall we continue?"
until the user inputs "no". Then the program should print out "okay then" and finish.

Example:
    hello world!
    shall we continue? >> yes
    hello world!
    shall we continue? >> oui
    hello world!
    shall we continue? >> jawohl
    hello world!
    shall we continue? >> no
    okay then

Write a program which asks the user for integer numbers.

- If the number is below zero, the program should print out the message "invalid number".
- If the number is above zero, the program should print out the square root of the number using the Python sqrt function.
- In either case, the program should then ask for another number.
- If the user inputs the number zero, the program should stop asking for numbers and exit the loop.

To use the `sqrt` function in python add the following to the top of your file: 
    from math import sqrt
Then use it like:
    print(sqrt(9))
    
Example:
    Please type in a number: >> 16
    4.0
    Please type in a number: >> 4
    2.0
    Please type in a number: >> -3
    invalid number
    Please type in a number: >> 1
    1.0
    Please type in a number: >> 0

Write a program which asks the user for a year, and prints out the next leap year.
If the user inputs a year which is a leap year (such as 2024), the program should print out the following leap year.

Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers. 
The program should keep asking for numbers until the user types in 0.

After reading the numbers the program should 
  - print out how many numbers were typed in
  - the sum of numbers entered
  - the mean of numbers entered
  - the number of positive and negative numbers entered
  
Example output
  Numbers typed in 4
  The sum of the numbers is 34
  The mean of the numbers is 8.5
  Positive numbers 3
  Negative numbers 1

Largest Number

Write a program which asks the user for float numbers.
The program should keep asking for numbers until the user types in 0 or a negative number.
The program should then print the largest number.
If the first number entered is less than or equals to 0, the program should quit and print "no number entered".

Examples:
  Number 1: >> 3
  Number 2: >> 4.67
  Number 3: >> 120.5
  Number 4: >> 70
  Number 5: >> 0
  The largest number is 120.5
  
  Number 1: >> -1.11
  No number entered.

Write a program that reads in an integer number (number of lines) and generates the subsequent output using 
two loops on the console (see below). 
If the input of numbers is smaller or equal to 0 an error message should be printed.

Examples:
  n: >> 4
  1
  2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9 10
  
  n: >> -1

Write a program that uses loops to create a pyramid of stars '*' on the console. 
The pyramid should have exactly 6 rows.

Write a program to calculate the average grade. The console reads in grades between 1 and 5 
until the number 0 is entered. If an invalid grade is entered, an error message is displayed, 
the grade is not counted and the prompt progresses. It is assumed that only integers are entered. 
At the end of the input, the grade average and the number of negatives (grade = 5) are output.

Example:
  Mark 1: >> 5
  Mark 2: >> 3
  Mark 3: >> 10
  Invalid mark!
  Mark 3: >> 1
  Mark 4: >> 5
  Mark 5: >> 0
